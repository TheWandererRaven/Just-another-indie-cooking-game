# Just-another-indie-cooking-game

Hi!

I will use this repository to work on my game with the same title.

So far I only have a Game Jolt page for the game:


By far this game has...nothing, I'm currently doing the planning
Here's the list of things I have to do, pretty much in chronological order:
  -Start by doing the design for the mechanics and gameplay
  -Proceed to make the game models
  -Prepare the scene and other sweaks for Unity
  -Add the models to Unity and arrange them on the scene so it matches the plans I have for the spaces, I'll put the required hitboxes for the models and the worlspace
  -Make the player character (not models yet) with just wolrd movement and camera movement
  -Test character movement on the world and adjust hitboxes, movement settings to inprove movement overall
  -Properly make the food GameObjects (food script, ingredient script, pickable script)
  -Make the player able to pick up items (script)
  -Properly implement scripts to machines (for phase one)
