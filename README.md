# Just-another-indie-cooking-game

Hi!

I will use this repository to work on my game with the same title.

If you will be looking at the code I have no problem but I encourage you to play the game first as for this will spil some secrets and stuff about the game.

So far I only have a Game Jolt page for the game:
https://gamejolt.com/games/ligma/384044

By far this game has...nothing, I'm currently doing the planning
Here's the list of things I have to do, pretty much in chronological order by phases:

1. Basic functionality (Player, Fries & Burgers)
	 - [ ] Start by doing the design for the mechanics and gameplay
		 - [X] Player movement
	   - [ ] Player/object pick up & drop mechanics
	 	 - [X] Machine/food cooking mechanic
	 - [ ] Proceed to make the game models
	 - [ ] Prepare the scene and other sweaks for Unity
	 - [ ] Add the models to Unity and arrange them on the scene so it matches the plans I have for the spaces, I'll put the required hitboxes for the models and the worlspace
	 - [ ] Make the player character (not models yet) with just wolrd movement and camera movement
	 - [ ] Test character movement on the world and adjust hitboxes, movement settings to inprove movement overall
	 - [ ] Properly make the food GameObjects (food script, ingredient script, pickable script)
	 - [ ] Make the player able to pick up items (script)
	 - [ ] Properly implement scripts to machines
   - [ ] Simple testing
   - [ ] Adjust if needed
   - [ ] Implement ordering system
   - [ ] Implement food validation system
   - [ ] Simple testing
   - [ ] Adjust if needed
   
Up to this point there will be no animations, detailed lighning nor more rooms

btw, ligma.
